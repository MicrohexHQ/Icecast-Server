Attacks have been published that are computationally faster than a full brute-force attack, though none as of 2013 are computationally feasible.[1] For AES-128, the key can be recovered with a computational complexity of 2126.1 using the biclique attack. For biclique attacks on AES-192 and AES-256, the computational complexities of 2189.7 and 2254.4 respectively apply. Related-key attacks can break AES-192 and AES-256 with complexities 2176 and 299.5 in both time and data, respectively.[2
